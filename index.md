Hey everyone!
Thank you for visiting my github blog, this is where I will post all my blogs for the ST 558 class throughtout the semester.
I am a current Master's student at NC State in my final semester! I will be graduating in December 2023. I am interested in pursuing a career as a statistician and data scientist, particularly in the field of healthcare, biology, or environmental sciences.

My email is kedupug@ncsu.edu if you would like to contact me.


My favorite color is green.
