Based on the article readings, I believe that the role of a data scientist has more to do with furthering business problems using data.
In terms of the knowledge area, having math/statistical knowledge, background in computer science mainly in programming languages such as Python and SQL, predictive modeling/machine learning, and domain knowledge.
There are quite a few similarities between statisticians and data scientists, knowledge of statistical analysis, knowledge of programming languages, data visualization skills, mathematical background, and knowledge of machine learning.
Statisticians and data scientists work in various different industries such as tech, healthcare, finance, and more, but statisticians have more of a chance to work in academia, government, or research institutions. Statisticians also focus more on developing statisical methods, designing experiments, and applying statistical methodology/modeling.
I would say that I am between a statistician and data scientist. I want to work in both fields to gain an understanding of both and move my career forward from there. Excited to take this class and hope to learn a lot.
