Project 3 was a great experience, I really learned a lot both about modeling and coding. It was a great culminating experience 
which combined all aspects we have learned so far such as data manipulation, github, exploratory data analysis, and modeling. I 
think the main thing I would do differently would be the modeling, mainly doing more research about how different tuning parameters
are selected and also looking more in depth into different models. I used two different models which I learned in a different class
which was pretty cool. Additionally, would like definitly do some more with variable selection, we only used it in the first model 
when choosing the best logisitic model. The most difficult part was definitly setting up the modeling for each model. The main thing
that I had issues was with the diabetes variable being numeric and had to change it to a factor to use it in the model which took some
time although it should not have. Additionally, calculating the logLoss metrics for model evaluation was pretty difficult, but I managed
to figure it out in the end, I did use a different package instead of manually calculating it. My main takeaways are definitly in modeling
reports and learning more about data modeling. Learned about a new metric that can be used for classification problems! Overall, very nice
project.
