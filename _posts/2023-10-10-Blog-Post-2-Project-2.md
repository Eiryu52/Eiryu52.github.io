For my project, I used the fruityvice api at https://www.fruityvice.com/doc/index.html. There were 5 different endpoints and I created 4 
function to call 4 different endpoints with some way to change the parameter(s) in function based on data you want to see. I did not find 
anything particularly spectacular, it was things that I had expected. One surprising thing was how sugar did not have a correlation with 
calories for fruits. I definitely learned a lot from this project, especially about github. I was struggling a lot in terms of setting it up
and how it works, but in the end I eventually got it. I also learned about API's and being able to get data for analysis using R which is 
very nice. I did want to use a PokemonAPI because there would be a plethora of data, but trying to clean it and make sense it was too much because of the way the data is structured, thus I went with the fruityvice API. One thing that I would like would have been more types of fruit in the API, there were a total of 45 fruit even though there are over 2000 types of fruit, so the analysis was kind of tough to do with limited observations. In addition, apples as a category have around 7500 different types! I think this API can be very useful in the future as a way to document more types of fruit and their nutritional values. We could extend this to other food groups as well! I hope for future type projects, I can find a way to make other API cleaner so that I can do analysis, that way, I can practice more on programming and how to do more data cleaning tasks. Overall fun project, although definitely did struggle on github. Link to my project and repo below.
